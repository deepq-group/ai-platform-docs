# ⬆ Upload & Manage Image Data

## Upload from My Computer <a href="#232-upload-from-my-computer" id="232-upload-from-my-computer"></a>

Users may upload zipped dataset from the user's device. It is highly recommended to run the "[Dataset Check Tool](https://console.deepq.ai/docs/console/dataset/2.3-upload-dataset/dataset-check-tool.html)" before zip & upload. The total upload time depends on the connection speed and the size of the dataset.

## Import from Dataset Gallery <a href="#233-dataset-gallery" id="233-dataset-gallery"></a>

Other than uploading datasets from a local computer, users may select datasets that have been uploaded to the DeepQ AI platform's dataset gallery. Please contact the system admin or DeepQ personnel to learn more about these datasets.

## Manage Datasets <a href="#24-manage-datasets" id="24-manage-datasets"></a>

#### Upload issues: Alert Message <a href="#upload-issues-alert-message" id="upload-issues-alert-message"></a>

The alert message of “preparation failed” is presented if the dataset format you uploaded is not compatible. Click on the dataset and view the error message. You can either save the successful cases and continue, or you can delete the entire dataset and upload a new one.

#### Delete a Dataset <a href="#delete-a-dataset" id="delete-a-dataset"></a>

Rules of deleting a dataset:

* The dataset you want to delete should not be related to any existing annotation project or training task. If it is related, then you need to delete that project/ task first before deleting the dataset.
