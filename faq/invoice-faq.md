Yes. If you need to issue a uniform number for your invoice, please fill the invoice information. Please note that once an invoice is issued with a company’s uniform number, the invoice cannot be changed to a personal invoice or changed to another company’s uniform number.

### 7. Can my invoice change to a personal invoice or company invoice once it has been already issued?

Based on the unified invoice regulation, an invoice cannot be changed to a company invoice with a unified number once the invoice has been issued in the name of a person. Similarly, it cannot be changed to a personal invoice if the invoice has already been issued for a company with a unified number. Once the invoice is issued, the name of the buyer and the uniform number cannot be changed.
