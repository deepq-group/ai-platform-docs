### **1**.**How do I pay for the DeepQ AI Platform service?**

You are required to add your credit card information and invoice details before creating a training task. Service fees are charged for each training task. 

### **2. Should I pay for the DeepQ AI Platform service in advance?**

The training period and training fees are estimated by the DeepQ AI Training system after you upload the dataset and select a training model. You will be charged in advance only if the estimated training fees are more than NTD$20,000. By contrast, the training fees will be charged after your training task is completed or stopped if the estimated training fees are below NTD$20,000. 

### **3. If the service fees are charged in advance, will I get a refund if the real training time is less than the time estimated by system? What amount would be presented on my electronic invoice?**

DeepQ will refund the fee difference between the real and estimated training time for your training task. The invoice will be issued after your training task is completed. Hence, the amount presented on your electronic invoice is the final training fee for your training task.

### **4. Why can I not download the training model and implement model testing?**

There might be some issues in your transaction. Please check the status of your transaction with your credit card issuing bank. These functions will be unblocked once the transaction issued solved. 

### **5. Will I be charged when a training task fails?**

If your task fails during the training process, you will not be charged. Also, the system will not generate any fee until your task enters the training process.
