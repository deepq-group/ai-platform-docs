### DeepCap <a href="#deepcap-overview" id="deepcap-overview"></a>

The quality & quantity of datasets is the key to high performing AI models, but traditionally, preparing datasets is a tedious and lengthy process. DeepCap is designed with a highly intuitive interface, and includes critical features such as project management, AI-assisted annotation, and smart validation, to help you better prepare high-quality reliable data for training.

**Project**: Person who create a project will be the project owner. The project owner can check and manage all the projects in this tab.

**Dataset**: You can upload datasets in this tab.The system has imposes some limitations on your dataset, please refer to the [‚ÄúDataset Format‚Äù](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-LRpbrznmSNshCiwmSTG-3251841457/dataset/upload-dataset) and[ "Annotation Data Format"](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-LRpbrznmSNshCiwmSTG-3251841457/dataset/annotation-data-formats) tab for detailed information.

**My Job**: Annotators/Reviewers can view and work on the jobs assigned to them by a project owner.

### AI Training <a href="#ai-training-overview" id="ai-training-overview"></a>

Our no-code AI training module eliminates the entry barrier of AI. Without any computer science background necessary, all you need is a good idea and data, our AutoML engine kicks in to train a high performing model in the least amount of time.
