## How Projects work

Annotation can be a team based effort. Create your annotation project, provide instructions, set timelines, manage workforce, dispatch tasks and check the real-time progress. Export your annotation results anytime and start training AI models.

* ![](https://console.deepq.ai/docs/console/.gitbook/assets/con-icon-6.png) **Search:** Search for your uploaded dataset by its name.
* ![](https://console.deepq.ai/docs/console/.gitbook/assets/con-icon-4.png) **Upload Dataset:** Click on this button and upload your dataset in DICOM/ JPG, PNG form.
* DICOM, JPG and PNG are acceptable image format. Both width and height should be between 16px and 4096px.
* If there is no annotation data, the user has to create an annotation data via annotation project, or else it cannot be used to train an AI model.
* Users can hide the datasets without annotation by the toggle button "HIDE DATASET WITHOUT ANNOTATION DATA"
* The number of annotation data attached is shown, each dataset can have mutiple annotation data of differet types of labeling and number of studies (subsets).
* The Dataset list shows all the datasets uploaded by the user and # of studies contained in each dataset
