# üìù Annotation Projects

In annotation project for deep learning, the project owner uploads medical images and sets up the project (including annotation types, class names, project dates, reviewing method and other instructions). They invite annotators and reviewers to help.

## How Projects work

Annotation can be a team based effort. Create your annotation project, provide instructions, set timelines, manage workforce, dispatch tasks and check the real-time progress. Export your annotation results anytime and start training AI models.

* &#x20;![](<../../.gitbook/assets/icon\_add (1).png>)**Create Project:** Create a new annotation project.
* ![](../../.gitbook/assets/icon\_magnify.png) **Search:** Click on this button and upload your dataset in DICOM/ JPG, PNG form.
* DICOM, JPG and PNG are acceptable image format. Both width and height should be between 16px and 4096px.
* If there is no annotation data, the user has to create an annotation data via annotation project, or else it cannot be used to train an AI model.
* Users can hide the datasets without annotation by the toggle button "HIDE DATASET WITHOUT ANNOTATION DATA"
* The number of annotation data attached is shown, each dataset can have mutiple annotation data of differet types of labeling and number of studies (subsets).
* The Dataset list shows all the datasets uploaded by the user and # of studies contained in each dataset
