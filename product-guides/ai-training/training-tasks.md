# ⚙ Training Tasks

DeepQ AI Training is where the neural network meets datasets. By training tasks users can create their AI applications with their own data.

Within this section, users can access and manage various training tasks, each tailored to specific requirements. These tasks encapsulate the configurations, parameters, and details necessary for training neural networks using labeled images. It's a centralized space that tracks and organizes all ongoing and past training endeavors.



### Task List

In the “Task” tab, you can view the training status of all the tasks that you have created.

**CREATION TIME:** Filter your tasks by "CREATION TIME" or "FINISH TIME".

### Task Detail

Clicking on any training task will take you to the task detail page.

From top to bottom:

* Task Training progress, including creation time, training duration & total GPU-hrs spent
* Training information: training dataset, model architecture and hyperparameters
* training report: real-time training accuracy & training curves (detailed pdf report downloadable)
* Dataset Statistics: Statistics of training data (training set & validation set)，in the form of both bar charts and table.
