## Image Annotation

### Annotation view instructions:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/annotation labels.png>)

* Choose the annotation labels from the right column to add on the image.
* You can select one of the labels for the entire case. If there are no labels can be annotated, please select “Nothing to Label”.

![](../.gitbook/assets/WWWL.png)

* You can view the WW/WL of that image by the top left button, select it to adjust the WW/WL of the image.
* Click on ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Filled Copy 2 (1).svg>) _\*\*_ and slide to zoom in and zoom out the images.

#### After labeling the case:

Click on “SUBMIT” after annotating each case. You can also click on “<<” to go back to the last case or click on “>>” to go to the next page without submission.

#### Notice:

* Once the case is submitted, the label cannot be changed unless returned by reviewer
*   For larger images (>1000 both side), it may take some time to process complex annotation (e.g. segmentation), therefore it takes a while to reflect the changes after submit.

Make sure to click on "**SUBMIT**" button to send out your review results

* Return：The annotation is sent back to the annotator with comments attached.
