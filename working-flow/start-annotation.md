* The annotator may also leave image-level or object-level comments in the annotation viewer. the comments will be passed down to the reviewer/project owner and will be recorded in the annotation project detail.

#### After labeling the case:

Click on “**SUBMIT**” after annotating each case. You can also click on “<<” to go back to the last case or click on “>>” to go to the next page without submission.

#### Notice:

* Once the case is submitted, the label cannot be changed unless returned by reviewer
*   For larger images (>1000 both side), it may take some time to process complex annotation (e.g. segmentation), therefore it takes a while to reflect the changes after submit.
