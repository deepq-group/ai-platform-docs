# 4.1.4 Dicom Specialized Training (SSDL)

### Smart Scan Deep Learning (SSDL)

Smart Scan Deep Learning (SSDL) is a advanced technique that can optimize the training results of Dicom images. SSDL will automatically activate when Dicom format in the dataset are detected.

### Prevent Data Leakage

Data Leakage during training happens when the train/validate split is not handled carefully, causing some of the validation data contains information from the training data. As a result the validation score might overperform and be misleading.

In medical scans with image series, information might be shared between slices in a single scan. Therefore, splitting data by study prevents data leakage, as shown in the figure below.

### Activating SSDL

When the user selects a dataset in training tasks, the system will detect whether the dataset contains sequential information.
