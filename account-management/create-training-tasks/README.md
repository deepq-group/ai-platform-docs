# 4.1 Create Training Tasks

Clicking on the "**CREATE NEW TASK**" tab leads you to selecting one of the training task flows:

1. **General Training**：To train an AI model of any topic based on the user's choice
2. **Specialized training**：To train an AI for a specific topic using the presets on DeepQ AI Platform
3. **Existing Model Retraining**：Using the user's previously trained AI model as a starting point to start a new training task.

The different options between these three flows are laid out in the table below:

|                               | Annotation type | Neural Network | Tuning Methods                                                |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **General Training**          | Any             | Selectable     | <p>Auto <em>with preferences</em></p><p>/ Full Manual</p>     |
| **Specialized Training**      | Specific        | Fixed          | <p>Auto <em>without preferences</em> </p><p>/ Full Manual</p> |
| **Existing Model Retraining** | Specific        | Fixed          | <p>Auto <em>without preferences</em> </p><p>/ Full Manual</p> |

### General Training

The first step of general training is to select the task type: image classification, object detection or Object segmentation

### Specialized Training

With specialzed training, the user may choose from various topics that has been prepared by DeepQ
