# 4.1 Create Training Tasks

Clicking on the "**CREATE NEW TASK**" tab leads you to selecting one of the training task flows:

1. General Training：To train an AI model of any topic based on the user's choice
2. Specialized training：To train an AI for a specific topic using the presets on DeepQ AI Platform
3. Existing Model Retraining：Using the user's previously trained AI model as a starting point to start a new training task.

The different options between these three task flows are laid out in the table below:

|                           | Annotation type | Neural Network | Tuning Methods                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| General Training          | Any             | Selectable     | Auto _with preferences_/ Full Manual     |
| Specialized Training      | Specific        | fixed          | Auto _without preferences_ / Full Manual |
| Existing Model Retraining | Specific        | fixed          | Auto _without preferences_ / Full Manual |
