# 2. Select Model & Tuning methods

## Auto Select:

* Input your data type & training preference for us to suggest a neural network that meets you needs.

## Manually Select:

* There are over 200 neural netwok \* pre-train combinations in the DeepQ AI Training model zoo that utilizes [transfer learning](../../working-flow-1/what-is-deep-learning.md#what-is-transfer-learning) for faster & better training results.
* Expand model list to select the model you want to deploy.
* "**My Models**" appears at the bottom of the list, which show models that are trained previously by the user. Users can further fine tune their models with different datasets or improve their models with the MLOPs cycle.
* for more manual tuning options, please refer to [Model Training & Hyperparameter tuning explained](../model-training-and-hyperparameter-tuning-explained.md)
