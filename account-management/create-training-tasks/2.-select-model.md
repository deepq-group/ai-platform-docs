# 4.1.2 Select Model & Tuning methods

## Auto Select:

* Input your data type & training preference for us to suggest a neural network that meets you needs.
* The options for data type & training preference will not appear in "Specialized Training" & "Existing Model Retraining"

## Manually Select:

* There are over 200 neural netwok \* pre-train combinations in the DeepQ AI Training model zoo that utilizes [transfer learning](../../working-flow-1/what-is-deep-learning.md#what-is-transfer-learning) for faster & better training results.
* Expand model list to select the model variation you want to use.
* Neural Network in "Specialized Training" & "Existing Model Retraining" are pre-determined.
* For more manual tuning options, please refer to [Model Training & Hyperparameter tuning explained](../model-training-and-hyperparameter-tuning-explained.md)
