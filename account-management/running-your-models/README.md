# Running Your Models

## Deploy Model & Inference

* You have to deploy the model before creating any inference task.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy.png)

* There are two modes of model inference: batch & real-time.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/batch-and-realtime.png)

* Real-time inference: Select and open one JPG/ PNG image from your local device, the inference result will be shown automatically .
