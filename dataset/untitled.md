**UPLOADED \(C\):** You can find the date on which your dataset was uploaded. 

**ANNOTATION \(D\):** You can easily recognize which datasets have been already annotated.

## Delete Dataset

Please note that there are some rules to delete a dataset.

* The dataset you want to delete should not be related to any existing annotation project. If it is related, then you need to delete that project first and then delete the dataset.
* The dataset you want to delete should not be related to any existing training task and annotated dataset. If it is related, then you need to delete that training task first and then delete the annotated dataset. Finally, you can delete the dataset.
