# 1.1 What is Deep Learning?

## Deep Learning and its application in image analysis

"Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised" -- **Wikipedia**
