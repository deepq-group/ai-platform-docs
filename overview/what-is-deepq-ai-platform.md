* DeepQ AI Platform dramatically reduces the learning thresholds and the cost of AI model training through efficient image annotation tools, optimized training environment, built-in multiple AI models, fully automated parameter tuning, and a simple user interface.
* It is different from the existing AI training platforms and services available on the market, users of DeepQ AI Platform can quickly convert their own medical image data into the AI models without the knowledge and skills of deep learning.\


### Deep Learning and its application in image analysis <a href="#deep-learning-and-its-application-in-image-analysis" id="deep-learning-and-its-application-in-image-analysis"></a>

"Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised" \~[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep\_learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep/\_learning)\~

Deep learning uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from the raw input, achieving great breakthroughs in certain applications, especially in image analysis.

**Image Classification (including single-label & multi-label):** Contextual image classification, a topic of pattern recognition in computer vision, is an approach of classification based on contextual information in images. The goal of this approach is to classify the images by using the contextual information. _\*\*_ \~[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual\_image\_classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual/\_image/\_classification)\~

**Object Detection:** Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. \~[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object\_detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object/\_detection)\~

**Image Segmentation:** In digital image processing and computer vision, image segmentation is the process of _\*\*_ partitioning a digital image into multiple image segments, also known as image regions or image objects (sets of pixels). \~[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image\_segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image/\_segmentation)\~
